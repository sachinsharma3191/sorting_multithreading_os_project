# OS Multithreading Sorting Project 

##  Benchmarking Sorting Algorithms (Merge/Quick Sort) Performance in a Multithreading Environment Using Two Java Programs
We have used two programs to benchmark sorting performance: Simple Thread and Fork Join Pool. The Fork Join Pool process runs faster than the Simple Thread, sorting 2^32 elements in just 10 seconds.
